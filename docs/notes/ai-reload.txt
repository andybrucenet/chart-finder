* Working directory for chat session is $HOME/proj/git/src/github.com/andybrucenet/chart-finder. Will refer to this as CF_HOME.
* Reload docs/notes/project-for-ai.md which contains overview and *project rules for you*
* Reload docs/notes/current-chat.md (chat session) which contains session info, TODO, and Next Steps
* Very important rule: do *not generate or modify code on disk* unless specifically asked!

Analyze the "Next Steps" and give me a summary of what needs to be worked on today. You may also give me your advice on prioritization and efficiency in executing the next steps.
