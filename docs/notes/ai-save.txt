Update docs/notes/current-chat.md with the current chat state. I understand chat context is finite so I want current-chat.md to be optimized so it saves as much state as is reasonable. When you have done this, please prompt me for the next steps to be worked for next session. These next steps will always be stored in current-chat.md. Please prompt me for the next goals to accomplish.
