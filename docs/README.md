# docs

- Purpose: High-level project documentation and architecture references.
- Subfolders: `notes/` for time-stamped journals.
- Cookbooks: `cookbooks/backend/` hosts provider-specific developer guides (e.g., `aws.md`).
- Contribution: When adding new design or process docs, link them here for discoverability.
