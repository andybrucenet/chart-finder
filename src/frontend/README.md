# src/frontend

Client applications (mobile, web, or desktop) live here. Follow [`docs/notes/setup/flutter-fvm.md`](../docs/notes/setup/flutter-fvm.md) before touching the Flutter stack so everyone shares the pinned SDK.

## Projects
- `chart-finder-react/` – Expo/React Native skeleton; see that folder's `README.md`.
- `chart-finder-flutter/` – Flutter seed app; read its `README.md` plus the shared FVM guide.

## Guidance
- Capture framework decisions in this directory before adding new stacks.
- Keep naming in sync with backend conventions for clarity across solutions.
