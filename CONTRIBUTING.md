# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Chart Finder! We don’t have a formal contribution guide yet, but we welcome feedback:

- **Issues / Ideas** – open a GitHub issue describing the bug or feature request.
- **Pull Requests** – send a PR referencing the issue (or include context in the description) so we can discuss the change.

Once we see recurring contribution patterns we’ll expand this document with coding standards, review expectations, and CI details. Until then, feel free to reach out via issues/PRs and we’ll collaborate from there.***
