This is the chart-finder repository.

Designed for musicians - play a tune, get the name, find the best charts available.

## Developer Cookbooks
- Backend (AWS): see `docs/cookbooks/backend/aws.md` for daily commands and troubleshooting.

## One-Time AWS Setup
- Before running any scripts, read `docs/notes/sso-cli-setup.md` for Identity Center guidance (browser isolation, delegated admin registration, CLI profiles).
- Admins should complete the delegated-admin step in that note from the payer account, then follow `scripts/admin/README.md` for the dev bootstrap flow.
